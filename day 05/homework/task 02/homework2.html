<h1>SHREK</h1>
<hr>
<P>
    Shrek is an animated film produced by DreamWorks Animation and directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson. It’s based on a children’s book by William Steig, but the film takes a much more comedic, irreverent tone to appeal to both kids and adults. The main character, Shrek, is a green ogre who lives alone in a swamp and enjoys his solitude. His life is turned upside down when his swamp is overrun by fairy tale creatures, banished from the kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad.
    Shrek sets off on a mission to convince Farquaad to return the creatures to their homes in exchange for getting his swamp back. Along the way, he meets Donkey, a talkative donkey who becomes his loyal sidekick, and rescues Princess Fiona, a princess with a big secret: she turns into an ogre at night!
    The movie is a hilarious parody of traditional fairy tales, poking fun at well-known characters like Cinderella, Rapunzel, and The Big Bad Wolf. It also explores the unlikely romance between Shrek and Fiona and the growing friendship between Shrek and Donkey, with lots of humor and heart.
